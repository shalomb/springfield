# EPIC: Git Branching Model

## Context
We need a standardized git branching strategy to ensure collaboration consistency.
We will adopt a Trunk-Based Development model with short-lived feature branches.

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create Git Branching Strategy Document
  - Assigned to: Ralph
  - Feature Brief: docs/features/git-branching-model.md
  - BDD Scenarios: features/git_branching.feature
  - ADR: docs/adr/ADR-001-git-branching.md
  - Subtasks:
    - [ ] Draft `docs/standards/git-branching.md` defining Trunk Based Development
    - [ ] Define branch naming conventions (feat/, fix/, chore/)
    - [ ] Define merge strategy (Squash & Merge)
  - Success Criteria: Document exists and covers Main, Feature Branches, and Release Tags.
