# Springfield Protocol

A character-driven agentic development framework for lean, iterative product development.

---

## ⚡ 60-Second Overview

Springfield Protocol is a document-driven framework that coordinates a **Single Pizza Team** of 5 specialized agents to deliver high-quality code through the **Ralph Wiggum Loop**.

1.  **Specialized Agents:** Product, Planning, Build, Quality, and Release.
2.  **Stateless Engine:** The Ralph Wiggum Loop prevents context rot via ephemeral worktrees.
3.  **Two Diamonds:** Integrated Design Thinking and Agile Delivery flows.
4.  **Just CLI:** Simple commands: `just impersonate`, `just utilize`, `just flow`, `just loop`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Fast Track:** Read **[QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)** for common workflows and loops.
2.  **Setup:** Follow **[Getting Started](docs/how-to/getting-started.md)** to implement the protocol.
3.  **Master Model:** Understand the **[Concepts & Principles](docs/concepts/model.md)**.
