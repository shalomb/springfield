Perfect! Now I have full context. Let me provide a clear status summary and handoff guidance:

---

## 📊 **Current State Assessment (2026-02-21 17:16 GMT+1)**

### ✅ What's Complete
- **EPIC-005 Phase 2** is fully complete on `feat/epic-005-structured-output` (89 commits)
- **Tasks 1-2 shipped:** MarkdownSanitizer + Promise semantic contracts
- **Task 3 deferred:** JSON stream support blocked on external pi CLI enhancement
- **Test coverage:** 92%+ (57+ tests passing, zero regressions)
- **Release-ready:** Branch is merge-ready to main for v0.6.0-beta

### 🚧 What Needs Action (Immediate)
**Lovejoy's task - Release coordination:**
1. Merge `feat/epic-005-structured-output` → `main`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with Phase 2 summary
3. Create v0.6.0-beta release tag
4. Publish release notes

**Note:** FEEDBACK.md doesn't exist (no QA issues reported), so no blocking bugs.

### 📋 What's Next (v0.7.0 Planning)
The PLAN.md provides **4 path options** for v0.7.0:
- **Option A (Recommended):** Cost Controls & Model Optimization (3 weeks)
- **Option B:** Advanced Output Parsing (2 weeks)
- **Option C:** Enterprise Governance/Audit (4 weeks)
- **Option D:** Production Operations (Docker, K8s, monitoring) (2 weeks)

## 🎯 **Your Role as Lisa: What Should I Do?**

Since the feature branch is release-ready and no corrective tasks are needed, my next step is to:

1. **Coordinate with Marge** (Product Agent) on path selection for v0.7.0
2. **Create a detailed TODO.md** with the chosen epic's atomic tasks
3. **Prepare a new feature branch** for the next epic

**Would you like me to:**
- **A)** Wait for Lovejoy to complete the merge, then start v0.7.0 planning?
- **B)** Immediately coordinate path selection and create TODO.md for the next epic?
- **C)** Something else?

For now, I'm ready. The system is healthy. All lights are green. 🟢
