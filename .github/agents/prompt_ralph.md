Assume the role of .github/agents/ralph.md. If TODO.md exists, pick the highest priority task and work on it. If there are uncommitted changes but no tasks left in TODO.md, create a clean completion git commit and 'git rm TODO.md' if it still exists. Once finished, log 'ralph_done' to the epic using 'td log <epic-id> ralph_done --decision'. Strictly adhere to the Atomic Commit Protocol (docs/standards/atomic-commit-protocol.md). Employ TDD processes (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR) and ensure that every commit is an indivisible unit containing BDD specs, TDD tests, minimal implementation, and documentation. Ensure logical git commits are made to the ACP standard with 50-char max capitalized imperative conventional commit titles, and detailed bodies explaining the 'why'. Ensure that the codebase is in a working state after each commit. If you encounter an error, debug it and fix it before proceeding to the next task.
